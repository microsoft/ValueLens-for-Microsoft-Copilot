.SYNOPSIS
Mirrors the eight shared Fabric notebooks from `3. Fabric/notebooks/`
into the archived Copilot Studio add-on's local `_core` folder.

.DESCRIPTION
The source of truth for the shared notebooks is `3. Fabric/notebooks/`. To keep
the archived add-on copies consistent with the core, we mirror those notebooks into:

  3. Fabric/archive/extended/Fabric + Copilot Studio/notebooks/_core/

The former `_shared/notebooks/` second copy was redundant and is no longer generated.

Run this after editing any file in `3. Fabric/notebooks/`.

`Copilot_Audit_Log_Processor.ipynb` is deliberately NOT mirrored: it is a
downstream transform (parsed -> curated), not an ingester, and the add-ons
inherit it from the base `3. Fabric` build. It is listed in $excluded below.

.PARAMETER Check
When set, exits 1 if any destination differs from the source. Used by CI.

.EXAMPLE
.\scripts\sync-shared.ps1              # sync (writes)
.\scripts\sync-shared.ps1 -Check       # verify only (CI)
